        The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol
        describes a Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal mechanism
        for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with the
        offer/answer model. The ICE extension for Incremental
        Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a mechanism
        that allows ICE agents to shorten session establishment delays
        by making the candidate gathering and connectivity checking
        phases of ICE non-blocking and by executing them in parallel.

      <t>
        The vanilla specification of the Interactive Connectivity
        Establishment (vanilla ICE) protocol <xref target="RFC5245"/>
        describes a mechanism for NAT traversal that consists of three
        main phases: a phase where an agent gathers a set of candidate
        transport addresses (source IP address, port and transport
        protocol), a second phase where these candidates are sent to a
        remote agent and this gathering procedure is repeated and,
        finally, a third phase where connectivity between all candidates
        in both sets is checked (connectivity checks). Once these phases
        have been completed, and only then, can both agents begin
        communication. According to the Vanilla ICE specification the
        three phases above happen consecutively, in a blocking way,
        which may lead to undesirable latency during session
        establishment.
      </t>
      <t>
        The trickle ICE extension defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/> defines generic
        semantics required for these ICE phases to happen
        simultaneously, in a non-blocking way and hence speed up session
        establishment.
      </t>
      <t>
        The present specification defines a usage of trickle ICE with
        the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). It describes how ICE
        candidates are to be incrementally exchanged with SIP INFO
        requests and how the half and full-trickle modes defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/> are to be used by
        SIP User Agents (UAs) depending on their expectations for
        support of trickle ICE by a remote agent.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines a new Info Package
        <xref target="RFC6086"/> for use with Trickle ICE.

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification makes use of all terminology defined by the
        protocol for Interactive Connectivity Establishment in
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> and its Trickle ICE extension
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/>. It is assumed that
        the reader will be familiar with the terminology from both of
        them.

    <section title='Protocol Overview' anchor='overview'>
      <t>
        The semantics that vanilla ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/> defines
        for exchanging ICE candidates are exclusively based on use of
        Offers and Answers as per <xref target="RFC3264"/> over the
        Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566"/>.
        This specification extends these mechanism by allowing ICE
        candidates to also be sent after the completion of Offer/Answer
        negotiation, through the use of SIP INFO messages and a newly
        defined Info Package <xref target="RFC6086"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Specifically, in cases where trickle ICE is fully supported
        A typical exchange would happen along the following lines:
        The offerer would send an INVITE containing a subset of
        candidates and then wait for an early dialog to be established.
        Once that happens, it will be able to continue sending
        candidates through in INFO requests and within the same dialog.
      </t>
      <t>
        Similarly, once it has sent an answer (though not earlier)
        an answerer can continue "trickling" ICE candidates using INFO
        messages within the dialog established by its 183 Session
        Progress response. <xref target="fig-intro-example"/> shows such
        a sample exchange:

      <section title="Rationale. Why INFO" anchor="rationale">
        <t>
          The decision to use SIP INFO requests as a candidate transport
          method is based primarily on their lightweight nature. Once a
          dialog has been established, INFO messages can be exchanged
          both ways with no restrictions on timing and frequency and no
          risk of collision.
        </t>
        <t>
          On the other hand, using offer/answer and UPDATE requests,
          which from an <xref target="RFC5245"/> perspective is the
          traditional way of transporting ICE candidates, introduces
          the following complications:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">

            <t hangText="Need for a turn-based mechanism: ">
              <xref target="RFC3264"/> defines Offer/Answer as a
              strictly sequential mechanism. There can only be a maximum
              of one exchange at any point of time. Both sides cannot
              simultaneously send offers nor can they generate multiple
              offers prior to receiving an answer. Using UPDATEs for
              candidate transport would therefore imply the
              implementation of a candidate pool at every agent where
              candidates can be stored until it is once again that
              agent's "turn" to emit an answer or a new offer. Such an
              approach would introduce non-negligible complexity for no
              additional value.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Elevated risk of glare: ">
              The sequential nature of Offer/Answer also makes it
              impossible for both sides to send offers simultaneously.
              What's worse is that there are no mechanisms in SIP to
              actually prevent that. <xref target="RFC3261"/>, where
              the situation of offers crossing on the wire is described
              as "glare", only defines a procedure for addressing the
              issue after it has occurred. According to that procedure
              both offers are invalidated and both sides need to retry
              the negotiation after a period between 0 and 4 seconds.
              The high likelihood for glare to occur and the average two
              second backoff intervals would imply trickle ICE
              processing duration would not only fail to improve but
              actually exceed those of vanilla ICE.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          INFO messages have no impact on the Offer/Answer negotiation
          and are subject to none of the glare issues described above,
          which makes them a very convenient and lightweight mechanism
          for asynchronous delivery of candidates.
        </t>
        <t>
          Using in-dialog INFO messages also provides a way of
          guaranteeing that candidates are delivered end-to-end, between
          the same entities that are actually in the process of
          initiating a session. The alternative would have implied
          requiring support for Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU)
          <xref target="RFC5627"/> which, given GRUUs relatively low
          adoption levels, would have constituted too strong of
          constraint to the adoption of trickle ICE.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Discovery issues" anchor="disco-issues">
        <t>
          In order for to benefit from trickle ICE's full potential and
          reduce session establishment latency to a minimum, trickle ICE
          agents need to generate SDP offers and answers that contain
          incomplete, potentially empty sets of candidates. Such offers
          and answers can only be handled meaningfully by agents that
          actually support incremental candidate provisioning, which
          implies the need to confirm such support before actually using
          it.
        </t>
        <t>
          Contrary to other protocols, like XMPP
          <xref target="RFC6120"/>, where "in advance" capability
          discovery is widely implemented, the mechanisms that allow this
          for sip (i.e., a combination of UA Capabilities
          <xref target="RFC3840"/> and GRUU <xref target="RFC5627"/>)
          have only seen low levels of adoption. This presents an issue
          for trickle ICE implementations as SIP UAs do not have an
          obvious means of verifying that their peer will support
          incremental candidate provisioning.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "half trickle" mode of operation defined in the trickle
          ICE specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/>
          provides one way around this, by requiring first offers to
          contain a complete set of ICE candidates and only using
          incremental provisioning for the rest of the sessions.
        </t>
        <t>
          While using "half trickle" does provide a working solution it
          also comes at the price of increased latency.
          <xref target="disco"/> therefore makes several alternative
          suggestions that enable SIP UAs to engage in full trickle
          right from their first offer: <xref target="disco-prov"/>
          discusses the use of on-line provisioning as a means of
          allowing use of trickle ICE for all endpoints in controlled
          environments. <xref target="disco-leap"/> describes the
          possibility to simply assume support of trickle ICE in a
          "leap of faith" way by then falling back to regular
          Offer/Answer semantics. <xref target="disco-gruu"/> describes
          anticipatory discovery for implementations that actually do
          support GRUU and UA Capabilities and
          <xref target="half-full-trickle"/> discusses the implementation
          and use of "half trickle" by SIP UAs where none of the above
          are an option.

      </section>
      <section title="Relationship with the Offer/Answer Model">
        <t>
          It is important to note that this specification does not
          require, define, or even assume any mechanisms that would
          have an impact on the Offer/Answer model beyond the way it is
          already used by vanilla ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/>. From the
          perspective of all SIP middle boxes and proxies, and with the
          exception of the actual INFO messages, signalling in general
          and Offer/Answer exchanges in particular would look the same
          way for trickle as they would for vanilla ICE.

          It is important to note that, as displayed on
          <xref target="fig-oa-and-trickle"/>, exchanging candidates
          through SIP INFO messages are best represented as signalling
          between ICE agents and not between the traditional SIP and
          Offer/Answer modules of SIP User Agents. Such INFO requests
          do not impact the state of Offer/Answer, nor do they have an
          impact on the version number in the "o=" line. In that regard
          they are actually comparable to Peer Reflexive candidates that
          ICE agents can discover during ICE processing.

        Trickle ICE agents will construct offers and answers the same
        way a  <xref target="RFC5245"/> compatible agent would, with
        the following two main differences:
      </t>
      <t>
        First, all offers and answers sent by the trickle ICE capable
        agents MUST indicate support for trickle ICE through the
        "trickle" ice-options tag defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Second, with the possible exception of the first offer sent
        during half trickle negotiations, all offers and answers may
        contain all, some, or no ICE candidates at all.
      </t>
      <t>
        Once an agent has sent an offer or an answer indicating
        support for trickle ICE, it MUST be prepared to receive SIP
        INFO requests within that same dialog, containing additional
        candidates or an indication for the end of such candidates.
      </t>
      <t>
        Similarly, as soon as a SIP UA has established a dialog
        (including an early state one) it MAY begin sending INFO
        requests containing such additional candidates or
        end-of-candidates indications. Such INFO request MUST be sent
        within the dialog established by the SIP messages, which
        delivered the corresponding Offer and Answer. This is necessary
        so that the candidates from these INFO messages could be
        delivered to the same entities that initiated the session.
      </t>
      <section title="Encoding and Sending Candidate Information"
               anchor="info-sdp">
        <t>
          The use of SIP INFO requests happens within the context of an
          Info Package specifically defined for the purpose
          (<xref target="info-package"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          Such INFO requests are sent within an existing dialog. The
          MIME type for their payload MUST be set to 'application/sdp'.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since neither the "a=candidate" nor the "a=end-of-candidates"
          lines contain information matching them to a stream, this is
          handled through the use of MID <xref target="RFC3388"/>: all
          lines following an "a=mid" line, up until (and excluding) the
          next occurrence of an "a=mid" line, pertain the the "m=" line
          that the MID is referring to.
        </t>
        <t>
          All INFO requests MUST carry the ice-pwd and ice-ufrag
          attributes that would allow mapping them to a specific ICE
          generation. This would allow agents to disregard out of order
          requests that have, for example, arrived after an ICE restart
          and are no longer valid.
        </t>
        <t>
          Every INFO request MUST carry all candidates that the agent
          has previously sent within a dialog, in order to more easily
          avoid problems that would arise from misordering and
          unreliability.

        <t>
          SIP User Agents (UAs) that support and intend to use trickle
          ICE are REQUIRED by
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/> to indicate
          that in their offers and answers using the following
          attribute: "a=ice-options:trickle". This makes discovery
          fairly straightforward for answerers or for cases where
          offers need to be generated within existing dialogs (i.e.,
          when sending re-INVITE requests). In both scenarios prior
          SDP would have provided the necessary information.
        </t>
        <t>
          Obviously, prior SDP is not available at the time a first
          offer is being constructed and it is therefore impossible
          for ICE agents to determine support for incremental
          provisioning that way. The following options are suggested as
          ways of addressing this issue.

            The "half trickle" mode defined in
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/> allows an agent
            to initiate session negotiation and ICE processing as a

            ICE defines a mode of operation called "half
            trickle". With half trickle, agents initiate sessions the
            same way they
            would when using vanilla ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/>. This
            means that, prior to actually sending an offer, agents would
            first gather ICE candidates in a blocking way and then send them
            all in that offer. The blocking nature of the process would
            likely imply that some amount of latency will be accumulated and
            it is advised that agents try to anticipate it where possible.
            The upside is that the resulting offer would be compatible with
            vanilla ICE and legacy <xref target="RFC3264"/> endpoints both.
          </t>
          <t>
            A typical successful (half) trickle ICE exchange with SIP would

          Trickle ICE agents SHOULD therefore perform half trickle unless
          support for trickle has been confirmed for a specific answerer.
          This could either happen through the use of
          <xref target="RFC3840"/> in an endpoint specific way (e.g. with
          GRUU) or because it has been confirmed with an earlier
          Offer/Answer exchange within the same session.
        </t>
        <t>
          Assuming support for trickle MAY also be forced through
          configuration. This could, for example, be the case  in
          controlled environments where every agent is known to
          support trickle ICE.
        </t>
        <t>
          After receiving a half trickle offer (which is virtually
          equivalent to a vanilla ICE offer but with an extra indication
          for trickle ICE support), answerers can continue negotiation
          fully using trickle ICE semantics.

          This specification defines an Info Package meant for use by
          SIP user agents implementing Trickle ICE. Typically INFO

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>
          The purpose of the ICE protocol is to establish a media path.
          The candidates that this specification transports in INFO
          requests are part of this establishment. There is hence no way
          for them to be transported through the not yet existing media
          path.
        </t>
        <t>
          Candidates sent by a trickle ICE agent after the offer, are
          meant to follow the same signalling path and reach the same
          entity as the offer itself. While it is true that GRUUs can
          be used to achieve this, one of the goals of this
          specification is to allow operation of trickle ICE in as many
          environments as possible including those with no GRUU support.
          Using out-of-dialog SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY requests would not
