        The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol
        describes a Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal mechanism
        for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with the
        Offer/Answer model. The ICE extension for Incremental
        Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a mechanism
        that allows ICE agents to shorten session establishment delays
        by making the candidate gathering and connectivity checking
        phases of ICE non-blocking and by executing them in parallel.

      <t>
        The Interactive Connectivity Establishment protocol <xref target="RFC5245"/>
        (a.k.a. Vanilla ICE) describes a mechanism for NAT traversal that consists of three
        main phases: a phase where an agent gathers a set of candidate
        transport addresses (source IP address, port and transport
        protocol), a second phase where these candidates are sent to a
        remote agent and this gathering procedure is repeated and,
        finally, a third phase where connectivity between all candidates
        in both sets is checked (connectivity checks). Once these phases
        have been completed, and only then, can both agents begin
        communication. According to the Vanilla ICE specification the
        three phases above happen consecutively, in a blocking way,
        which can introduce undesirable latency during session
        establishment.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Trickle ICE extension defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/> defines generic
        semantics required for these ICE phases to happen
        simultaneously, in a non-blocking way and hence speed up session
        establishment.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines a usage of Trickle ICE with
        the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)<xref target="RFC3261"/>.
        It describes how ICE
        candidates are to be incrementally exchanged with SIP INFO
        requests and how the Half Trickle and Full Trickle modes defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/> are to be used by
        SIP User Agents (UAs) depending on their expectations for
        support of Trickle ICE by a remote agent.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines a new Info Package as specified in
        <xref target="RFC6086"/> for use with Trickle ICE.

      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

      <t>
        This specification makes use of all terminology defined by the
        protocol for Interactive Connectivity Establishment in
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> and its Trickle ICE extension
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/>. It is assumed that
        the reader will be familiar with the terminology from both of
        them.
      </t>

    <section title='Protocol Overview' anchor='overview'>
      <t>
        The semantics that Vanilla ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/> defines
        for exchanging ICE candidates are exclusively based on use of
        Offers and Answers as per <xref target="RFC3264"/> over the
        Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566"/>.
        This specification extends these mechanism by allowing ICE
        candidates to also be sent in parallel to the Offer/Answer
        negotiation or after the completion of Offer/Answer
        negotiation.
        This extension is done through the use of SIP INFO messages
        and a newly defined Info Package <xref target="RFC6086"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Typically, in cases where Trickle ICE is fully supported,
        a candidate exchange would happen along the following lines:
        The Offerer would send an INVITE containing a subset of
        candidates and then wait for an early dialog to be established.
        Once that happens, it will be able to continue sending
        candidates through in INFO requests and within the same dialog.
      </t>
      <t>
        Similarly, once it has sent an Answer (though not earlier)
        an Answerer can continue "trickling" ICE candidates using INFO
        messages within the dialog established by its 18x provisional
        response. <xref target="fig-intro-example"/> shows such a sample
        exchange:

      <section title="Rationale. Why INFO" anchor="rationale">
        <t>
          The decision to use SIP INFO requests as a candidate transport
          method is based primarily on their lightweight nature. Once a
          dialog has been established, INFO messages can be exchanged
          both ways with no restrictions on timing and frequency and no
          risk of collision.
        </t>
        <t>
          On the other hand, using Offer/Answer and UPDATE requests,
          which from an <xref target="RFC5245"/> perspective is the
          traditional way of transporting ICE candidates, introduces
          the following complications:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">

            <t hangText="Need for a non-blocking mechanism: ">
              <xref target="RFC3264"/> defines Offer/Answer as a
              strictly sequential mechanism. There can only be a maximum
              of one exchange at any point of time. Both sides cannot
              simultaneously send Offers nor can they generate multiple
              Offers prior to receiving an Answer. Using UPDATEs for
              candidate transport would therefore imply the
              implementation of a candidate pool at every agent where
              candidates can be stored until it is once again that
              agent's "turn" to emit an Answer or a new Offer. Such an
              approach would introduce non-negligible complexity for no
              additional value.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Elevated risk of glare: ">
              The sequential nature of Offer/Answer also makes it
              impossible for both sides to send Offers simultaneously.
              What's worse is that there are no mechanisms in SIP to
              actually prevent that. <xref target="RFC3261"/>, where
              the situation of Offers crossing on the wire is described
              as "glare", only defines a procedure for addressing the
              issue after it has occurred. According to that procedure
              both Offers are invalidated and both sides need to retry
              the negotiation after a period between 0 and 4 seconds.
              The high likelihood for glare to occur and the average two
              second backoff intervals would imply Trickle ICE
              processing duration would not only fail to improve but
              actually exceed those of Vanilla ICE.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          INFO messages decouple the exchange of candidates from the Offer/Answer negotiation
          and are subject to none of the glare issues described above,
          which makes them a very convenient and lightweight mechanism
          for asynchronous delivery of candidates.
        </t>
        <t>
          Using in-dialog INFO messages also provides a way of
          guaranteeing that candidates are delivered end-to-end, between
          the same entities that are actually in the process of
          initiating a session. The alternative would have implied
          requiring support for Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU)
          <xref target="RFC5627"/> which, given GRUUs relatively low
          adoption levels, would have constituted too strong of
          constraint to the adoption of Trickle ICE.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Discovery issues" anchor="disco-issues">
        <t>
          In order for to benefit from Trickle ICE's full potential and
          reduce session establishment latency to a minimum, Trickle ICE
          agents need to generate SDP Offers and Answers that contain
          incomplete, potentially empty sets of candidates. Such Offers
          and Answers can only be handled meaningfully by agents that
          actually support incremental candidate provisioning, which
          implies the need to confirm such support before actually using
          it.
        </t>

        <t>
          Contrary to other protocols, like XMPP
          <xref target="RFC6120"/>, where "in advance" capability
          discovery is widely implemented, the mechanisms that allow this
          for SIP (i.e., a combination of UA Capabilities
          <xref target="RFC3840"/> and GRUU <xref target="RFC5627"/>)
          have only seen low levels of adoption. This presents an issue
          for Trickle ICE implementations as SIP UAs do not have an
          obvious means of verifying that their peer will support
          incremental candidate provisioning.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Half Trickle mode of operation defined in the Trickle
          ICE specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/>
          provides one way around this, by requiring first Offers to
          contain a complete set of ICE candidates and only using
          incremental provisioning for the rest of the sessions.
        </t>
        <t>
          While using Half Trickle does provide a working solution it
          also comes at the price of increased latency.
          <xref target="disco"/> therefore makes several alternative
          suggestions that enable SIP UAs to engage in Full Trickle
          right from their first Offer: <xref target="disco-prov"/>
          discusses the use of on-line provisioning as a means of
          allowing use of Trickle ICE for all endpoints in controlled
          environments. <xref target="disco-gruu"/> describes
          anticipatory discovery for implementations that actually do
          support GRUU and UA Capabilities and
          <xref target="half-full-trickle"/> discusses the implementation
          and use of Half Trickle by SIP UAs where none of the above
          are an option.

      <section title="Relationship with the Offer/Answer Model">
        <t>
          It is important to note that this specification does not
          require, define, or even assume any mechanisms that would
          have an impact on the Offer/Answer model beyond the way it is
          already used by Vanilla ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/>. From the
          perspective of all SIP middle boxes and proxies, and with the
          exception of the actual INFO messages, signalling in general
          and Offer/Answer exchanges in particular would look the same
          way for Trickle ICE as they would for Vanilla ICE.

          It is important to note that, as displayed on
          <xref target="fig-oa-and-trickle"/>, exchanging candidates
          through SIP INFO messages are best represented as signalling
          between ICE agents and not between the traditional SIP and
          Offer/Answer modules of SIP User Agents. Such INFO requests
          do not impact the state of Offer/Answer, nor do they have an
          impact on the version number in the "o=" line. In that regard
          they are actually comparable to Peer Reflexive candidates that
          ICE agents can discover during ICE processing.

            Satisfying both conditions is also relatively trivial for
            ICE agents that have sent an Offer in an INVITE and that have
            received an Answer in a reliable provisioanl response.
            It is guaranteed to have confirmed support for
            Trickle ICE within the Answerer (or lack thereof) and to have
            fully initialized the SIP dialog at both ends.
            Offerers and Answerers in the above situation can therefore
            freely commence trickling within the newly established dialog.

            In order to clear this ambiguity as soon as possible,
            the answerer needs to retransmit the provisional response
            with the exponential backoff timers described in

            Retransmits MUST cease on receipt of a INFO request
            or on transmission of the answer in a 2xx response.
            This is similar to the procedure described in section

            The Offerer MUST send a Trickle ICE INFO request as soon as
            they receive an SDP Answer in an unreliable provisional
            response. This INFO message can  repeat the candidates
            that were already provided in the Offer (as would be the case
            when Half Trickle is performed or when new candidates have not
            been learned since then) or they can also deliver new
            new candidates (if available).

        Whenever new ICE candidates become available for sending,
        agents would encode them in "a=candidate" lines as described
        by <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/>. For example:
        </t>
        <t>

<![CDATA[
        a=candidate:2 1 UDP 1694498815 192.0.2.3 5000 typ srflx

          </figure>
        </t>
        <t>
          The use of SIP INFO requests happens within the context of the 
          Info Package as defined <xref target="info-package"/>.
          The MIME type for their payload MUST be set to
          'application/sdpfrag' as defined in
          <xref target="sdpfrag_def"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since neither the "a=candidate" nor the "a=end-of-candidates"
          attributes contain information that would allow correlating them to
          a specific "m=" line, this is handled through the use of
          pseudo "m=" lines and 
          identification tags in "a=mid:" attributes as defined in
          <xref target="RFC5888"/>. 
                    Pseudo "m=" lines follow the SDP syntax for "m=" lines as defined in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis"/>, but provide no semantics other than
          indicating to which "m=" line a candidate belongs.
          Consequently, the receiving agent MUST ignore the remaining content of the pseudo m-line.
        </t>
        <t>
          When sending the INFO request, the agent MAY include the same content into the pseudo m-line
          as for the corresponding Offer or Answer, if already known to the agent.
          However, since Trckle-ICE might be decoupled from the Offer/Answer negotiation this content might
          be unknown to the agent.
          In this case, the agent SHOULD include the following default values.
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              The media is set to 'audio'.
            </t>
            <t>
              The port value is set to '9'.
            </t>
            <t>
              The proto value is set to 'RTP/AVP'.
            </t>
            <t>
              The fmt SHOULD appear only once and is set to '0'
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
        Agents MUST include  a pseudo "m=" line and an
          identification tag in a "a=mid:" attribute for every "m=" line
          whose candidate list they intend to update.
          Such "a=mid:" attributes MUST
          immediately precede the list of candidates for that specific
          "m=" line. All "a=candidate" or "a=end-of-candidates" attributes
          following an "a=mid:" attribute, up until (and excluding) the next
          occurrence of an "a=mid:" attribute, pertain to the "m=" line
          identified by that identification tag.
          An "a=end-of-candidates" attribute, preceding
          any "a=mid:" attributes, indicates the end of all trickling from that
          agent,
          as opposed to end of trickling for a specific "m=" line,
          which would be indicated by a media level
          "a=end-of-candidates" attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
          The use of "a=mid:" attributes allows for a structure similar to
          the one in SDP Offers and Answers where
          separate media-level and session-level sections can be distinguished.
          In the current case, lines preceding any "a=mid:" attributes are considered
          to be session-level. Lines appearing in between or after
          "a=mid:" attributes will be interpreted as media-level.
        </t>
        <t>
          <list>
            <t>
              Note that while this specification uses the "a=mid:"
              attribute from <xref target="RFC5888"/>, it does not
              define any grouping semantics. Consequently, using the
              "a=group:" attribute from that same specification is neither
              needed nor used in Trickle ICE for SIP.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          All INFO requests MUST carry the "a=ice-pwd:" and "a=ice-ufrag:"
          attributes that would allow mapping them to a specific ICE
          generation. INFO requests containing "a=ice-pwd:" and "a=ice-ufrag:"
          attributes that do not match those of the current ICE processing
          session MUST be discarded. The "a=ice-pwd:" and "a=ice-ufrag:"
          attributes MUST appear at the same level as the ones in the
          Offer/Answer exchange. In other words, if they were present
          as sesssion-level attributes there, they will also appear
          at the beginning of all INFO message payloads, preceding all
          "a=mid:" attributes. If they were originally exchanged as media
          level attributes, potentially overriding session-level values,
          then they will also be included in INFO message payloads,
          following the corresponding "a=mid:" attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
          In every INFO request agents MUST include all local candidates
          they have previously signalled. This is necessary in order to
          more easily avoid problems that would arise from unreliability.
          Misordering can be detected through the CSeq: header field in the
          INFO request.
        </t>
        <t>
          When receiving INFO requests carrying any candidates, agents
          will therefore first identify and discard the SDP lines
          containing candidates they have already received in previous
          INFO requests or in the Offer/Answer exchange preceding them.
          Two candidates are considered to be equal if their IP address
          port, transport and component ID are the same. After
          identifying and discarding known candidates, agents will then
          process the remaining, actually new candidates
          according to the rules described in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/>.

    <section title="Initial discovery of Trickle ICE support"
               anchor="disco">
        <t>
          SIP User Agents (UAs) that support and intend to use trickle
          ICE are REQUIRED by
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/> to indicate
          that in their Offers and Answers using the following
          attribute: "a=ice-options:trickle". This makes discovery
          fairly straightforward for Answerers or for cases where
          Offers need to be generated within existing dialogs (i.e.,
          when sending re-INVITE requests). In both scenarios prior
          SDP would have provided the necessary information.
        </t>
        <t>
          Obviously, prior SDP is not available at the time a first
          Offer is being constructed and it is therefore impossible
          for ICE agents to determine support for incremental
          provisioning that way. The following options are suggested as
          ways of addressing this issue.
        </t>
        <section title="Provisioning support for Trickle ICE"
                 anchor="disco-prov">
          <t>
            In certain situations it may be possible for integrators
            deploying Trickle ICE to know in advance that some or all
            endpoints reachable from within the deployment will support
            Trickle ICE. This is likely to be the case, for example,
            for WebRTC clients that will always be communicating with
            other WebRTC clients or known Session Border Controllers
            (SBC) with support for this specification.
          </t>
          <t>
            While the exact mechanism for allowing such  provisioning
            is out of scope here, this specification encourages trickle
            ICE implementations to allow the option in the way they find
            most appropriate.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Trickle ICE discovery with GRUU"
                 anchor="disco-gruu">
          <t>
            <xref target="RFC3840"/> provides a way for SIP user agents
            to query for support of specific capabilities using, among
            others, OPTIONS requests. GRUU support on the other hand
            allows SIP requests to be addressed to specific UAs (as
            opposed to arbitrary instances of an address of record).
            Combining the two and using the "trickle-ice" option tag
            defined in <xref target="option-tag"/> provides SIP UAs with
            a way of learning the capabilities of specific US instances
            and then addressing them directly with INVITE requests that
            require SIP support.
          </t>
          <t>
            Such targeted trickling may happen in different ways. One
            option would be for a SIP UA to learn the GRUU
            instance ID of a peer through presence and to then query
            its capabilities direction with an OPTIONS request.
            Alternately, it can also just send an OPTIONS request to
            the AOR it intends to contact and then inspect the returned
            response(s) for support of both GRUU and Trickle ICE
            (<xref target="options-gruu"/>).

            XMPP together which also provides a way for dual stack
            SIP+XMPP endpoints to make use of such features and verify

            In cases where none of the other mechanisms in this section
            are acceptable, SIP UAs should use the Half Trickle mode
            defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice"/>.
            With Half Trickle, agents initiate sessions the same way
            they would when using Vanilla ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/>.
            This means that, prior to actually sending an Offer, agents
            would first gather ICE candidates in a blocking way and then
            send them all in that Offer. The blocking nature of the
            process would likely imply that some amount of latency will
            be accumulated and it is advised that agents try to
            anticipate it where possible, like for example, when user
            actions indicate a high likelyhood for an imminent call
            (e.g., activity on a keypad or a phone going offhook).
          </t>

          It is worth reminding that once a single Offer or Answer had
          been exchanged within a specific dialog, support for
          Trickle ICE will have been determined.
          No further use of Half Trickle will therefore be necessary
          within that same dialog
          and all subsequent exchanges can use the Full Trickle mode
          of operation.

        The following consideration describe options for Trickle-ICE
        in order to give some guidance to implementors on how trickling
        can be optimized with respect to providing RTCP candidates.
        However, these considerations are neither meant to be exhaustive nor
        guaranteed to be suitable for all sorts of deployments.
        </t>
        <t>
        Handling of RTCP and RCTP multiplexing <xref target="RFC5761"/> is already considered
        in sections 4.1.1.1, 4.3, and 5.7.1
        of <xref target="RFC5245"/>, respectively.
        These considerations are still valid for Trickle ICE, however,
        trickling provides more flexibility when candidates are exchanged,
        e.g. in case of RTCP multiplexing.
        </t>
        <t>
        While a Half Trickle Offerer would have to send an offer compliant to
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> including candidates for all components,
        this flexibility allows a Full Trickle Offerer
        to initially send only RTP candidates (component 1)
        if it assumes that RTCP multiplexing is supported by the Answerer.
        Full Trickle Offerer would need to start gathering and trickling
        RTCP candidates (component 2)
        only after having received an indication in the answer that
        the answerer unexpectedly does not support RTCP multiplexing.

           trickling provides more flexibility when candidates are exchanged.
        </t>
        <t>
        Except for bundle-only m-lines, a Half Trickle Offerer would have to
        send an offer with candidates for all bundled m-lines.
        The additional flexibility allows a Full Trickle Offerer
        to initially send only candidates for the m-line with the
        suggested offerer BUNDLE address.
        </t>
        <t>
        On receipt of the answer, the Full Trickle Offerer will detect
        if BUNDLE is supported and if the suggested offerer BUNDLE address was selected.
        If BUNDLE is not supported, the Full Trickle Offerer needs to gather and trickle for the
        remaining m-lines as necessary.
        If the answerer selects a Offerer BUNDLE address different from suggested Offerer BUNDLE address,
        the  Full Trickle Offerer needs to gather and trickle candidates
        for the m-line that carries the selected Offerer BUNDLE address.

          This specification defines an Info Package for use by
          SIP user agents implementing Trickle ICE.
          INFO requests carry ICE candidates discovered after the peer user
          agents have confirmed mutual support for Trickle ICE.

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>
          The purpose of the ICE protocol is to establish a media path
          in the presence of NAT and firewalls.
          The candidates are transported in INFO requests and are
           part of this establishment.
        </t>
        <t>
          Candidates sent by a Trickle ICE agent after the Offer,
          follow the same signalling path and reach the same
          entity as the Offer itself. While it is true that GRUUs can
          be used to achieve this, one of the goals of this
          specification is to allow operation of Trickle ICE in as many
          environments as possible including those without GRUU support.
          Using out-of-dialog SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY requests would not

           A Trickle ICE Agent with many network interfaces might create an

           Therefore, Trickle ICE Agent SHOULD wait for XXX ms or longer
           after the latest INFO request was sent before for sending newly
           detected candidates in a subsequent INFO request.
