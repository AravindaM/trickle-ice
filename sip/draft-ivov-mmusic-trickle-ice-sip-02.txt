       A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) usage for Trickle ICE
                  draft-ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip-02

Abstract

   The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a
   Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal mechanism for UDP-based
   multimedia sessions established with the offer/answer model.  The ICE
   extension for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE)
   defines a mechanism that allows ICE agents to shorten session
   establishment delays by making the candidate gathering and
   connectivity checking phases of ICE non-blocking and by executing
   them in parallel.

   This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

1.  Introduction

   The vanilla specification of the Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (vanilla ICE) protocol [RFC5245] describes a mechanism
   for NAT traversal that consists of three main phases: a phase where
   an agent gathers a set of candidate transport addresses (source IP

   address, port and transport protocol), a second phase where these
   candidates are sent to a remote agent and this gathering procedure is
   repeated and, finally, a third phase where connectivity between all
   candidates in both sets is checked (connectivity checks).  Once these
   phases have been completed, and only then, can both agents begin
   communication.  According to the Vanilla ICE specification the three
   phases above happen consecutively, in a blocking way, which may lead
   to undesirable latency during session establishment.

   The trickle ICE extension defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice]
   defines generic semantics required for these ICE phases to happen
   simultaneously, in a non-blocking way and hence speed up session
   establishment.

   The present specification defines a usage of trickle ICE with the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  It describes how ICE candidates
   are to be incrementally exchanged with SIP INFO requests and how the
   half and full-trickle modes defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice]
   are to be used by SIP User Agents (UAs) depending on their
   expectations for support of trickle ICE by a remote agent.

   This document defines a new Info Package [RFC6086] for use with
   Trickle ICE.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification makes use of all terminology defined by the
   protocol for Interactive Connectivity Establishment in [RFC5245] and
   its Trickle ICE extension [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice].  It is
   assumed that the reader will be familiar with the terminology from
   both of them.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The semantics that vanilla ICE [RFC5245] defines for exchanging ICE
   candidates are exclusively based on use of Offers and Answers as per
   [RFC3264] over the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].
   This specification extends these mechanism by allowing ICE candidates
   to also be sent after the completion of Offer/Answer negotiation,
   through the use of SIP INFO messages and a newly defined Info Package
   [RFC6086].

   Specifically, in cases where trickle ICE is fully supported A typical
   exchange would happen along the following lines: The offerer would

   send an INVITE containing a subset of candidates and then wait for an
   early dialog to be established.  Once that happens, it will be able
   to continue sending candidates through in INFO requests and within
   the same dialog.

   Similarly, once it has sent an answer (though not earlier) an
   answerer can continue "trickling" ICE candidates using INFO messages
   within the dialog established by its 183 Session Progress response.
   Figure 1 shows such a sample exchange:

3.1.  Rationale.  Why INFO

   The decision to use SIP INFO requests as a candidate transport method
   is based primarily on their lightweight nature.  Once a dialog has
   been established, INFO messages can be exchanged both ways with no
   restrictions on timing and frequency and no risk of collision.



Ivov, et al.            Expires December 17, 2014               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP                 June 2014


   On the other hand, using offer/answer and UPDATE requests, which from
   an [RFC5245] perspective is the traditional way of transporting ICE
   candidates, introduces the following complications:

   Need for a turn-based mechanism  [RFC3264] defines Offer/Answer as a
      strictly sequential mechanism.  There can only be a maximum of one
      exchange at any point of time.  Both sides cannot simultaneously
      send offers nor can they generate multiple offers prior to
      receiving an answer.  Using UPDATEs for candidate transport would
      therefore imply the implementation of a candidate pool at every
      agent where candidates can be stored until it is once again that
      agent's "turn" to emit an answer or a new offer.  Such an approach
      would introduce non-negligible complexity for no additional value.

   Elevated risk of glare  The sequential nature of Offer/Answer also
      makes it impossible for both sides to send offers simultaneously.
      What's worse is that there are no mechanisms in SIP to actually
      prevent that.  [RFC3261], where the situation of offers crossing
      on the wire is described as "glare", only defines a procedure for
      addressing the issue after it has occurred.  According to that
      procedure both offers are invalidated and both sides need to retry
      the negotiation after a period between 0 and 4 seconds.  The high
      likelihood for glare to occur and the average two second backoff
      intervals would imply trickle ICE processing duration would not
      only fail to improve but actually exceed those of vanilla ICE.

   INFO messages have no impact on the Offer/Answer negotiation and are
   subject to none of the glare issues described above, which makes them
   a very convenient and lightweight mechanism for asynchronous delivery
   of candidates.

   Using in-dialog INFO messages also provides a way of guaranteeing
   that candidates are delivered end-to-end, between the same entities
   that are actually in the process of initiating a session.  The
   alternative would have implied requiring support for Globally
   Routable UA URI (GRUU) [RFC5627] which, given GRUUs relatively low
   adoption levels, would have constituted too strong of constraint to
   the adoption of trickle ICE.

3.2.  Discovery issues

   In order for to benefit from trickle ICE's full potential and reduce
   session establishment latency to a minimum, trickle ICE agents need
   to generate SDP offers and answers that contain incomplete,
   potentially empty sets of candidates.  Such offers and answers can
   only be handled meaningfully by agents that actually support
   incremental candidate provisioning, which implies the need to confirm
   such support before actually using it.

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP                 June 2014


   Contrary to other protocols, like XMPP [RFC6120], where "in advance"
   capability discovery is widely implemented, the mechanisms that allow
   this for sip (i.e., a combination of UA Capabilities [RFC3840] and
   GRUU [RFC5627]) have only seen low levels of adoption.  This presents
   an issue for trickle ICE implementations as SIP UAs do not have an
   obvious means of verifying that their peer will support incremental
   candidate provisioning.

   The "half-trickle" mode of operation defined in the trickle ICE
   specification [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice] provides one way around
   this, by requiring first offers to contain a complete set of ICE
   candidates and only using incremental provisioning for the rest of
   the sessions.

   While using "half-trickle" does provide a working solution it also
   comes at the price of increased latency.  Section 4 therefore makes
   several alternative suggestions that enable SIP UAs to engage in full
   trickle right from their first offer: Section 4.1 discusses the use
   of on-line provisioning as a means of allowing use of trickle ICE for
   all endpoints in controlled environments.  Section 4.2 describes the
   possibility to simply assume support of trickle ICE in a "leap of
   faith" way by then falling back to regular Offer/Answer semantics.
   Section 4.3 describes anticipatory discovery for implementations that
   actually do support GRUU and UA Capabilities and Section 5 discusses
   the implementation and use of "half-trickle" by SIP UAs where none of
   the above are an option.

4.  Initial discovery of trickle ICE support

   SIP User Agents (UAs) that support and intend to use trickle ICE are
   REQUIRED by [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice] to indicate that in their
   offers and answers using the following attribute: "a=ice-
   options:trickle".  This makes discovery fairly straightforward for
   answerers or for cases where offers need to be generated within
   existing dialogs (i.e., when sending re-INVITE requests).  In both
   scenarios prior SDP would have provided the necessary information.

   Obviously, prior SDP is not available at the time a first offer is
   being constructed and it is therefore impossible for ICE agents to
   determine support for incremental provisioning that way.  The
   following options are suggested as ways of addressing this issue.

4.1.  Provisioning support for trickle ICE

   .

4.2.  Leap of faith.  Assuming support for trickle ICE

   .

4.3.  Conventional trickle ICE discovery with GRUU and UA Capabilities

   .

4.4.  Discovery through SDP

   Also, in addition to avoid backward compatibility issues, this
   specification mandates that, prior to initiating trickle ICE
   semantics, an agent confirms support of trickle ICE by their peer.
   This is either achieved through confirming user agent capabilities
   (which potentially requires support for GRUU) or through the half
   trickle mode defined in .

   Use of half trickle is particularly convenient for SIP as it provides
   a workaround for SIP's lack of reliable and widely deployed end-to-
   end capability discovery.  While [RFC3840] does define a way for SIP
   User Agents (UAs) to query their peers for capabilities, directing
   such queries to specific endpoints also requires support for GRUU.
   Without GRUU, there would be no guarantee that the endpoint that
   receives and handles an OPTIONS request carrying a capability query,
   is the same as the endpoint that will then receive and handle the
   following INVITE.

   Use of GRUU is one solution to this problem, and this specification
   allows that when available.  Making use of trickle ICE in more
   conventional SIP deployments, however, would only be possible through
   the half trickle semantics defined in Section 5.

5.  Half vs Full Trickle

   Trickle ICE defines a mode of operation called "half trickle".  With
   half trickle, agents initiate sessions the same way they would when
   using vanilla ICE [RFC5245].  This means that, prior to actually
   sending an offer, agents would first gather ICE candidates in a
   blocking way and then send them all in that offer.  The blocking
   nature of the process would likely imply that some amount of latency
   will be accumulated and it is advised that agents try to anticipate
   it where possible.  The upside is that the resulting offer would be
   compatible with vanilla ICE and legacy [RFC3264] endpoints both.

   A typical successful (half) trickle ICE exchange with SIP would look
   this way:

   Trickle ICE agents SHOULD therefore perform half trickle unless
   support for trickle has been confirmed for a specific answerer.  This
   could either happen through the use of [RFC3840] in an endpoint
   specific way (e.g. with GRUU) or because it has been confirmed with
   an earlier Offer/Answer exchange within the same session.

   Assuming support for trickle MAY also be forced through
   configuration.  This could, for example, be the case in controlled
   environments where every agent is known to support trickle ICE.

   After receiving a half trickle offer (which is virtually equivalent
   to a vanilla ICE offer but with an extra indication for trickle ICE
   support), answerers can continue negotiation fully using trickle ICE
   semantics.

6.  Performing trickle ICE with SIP

   This specification relies on in-dialog SIP INFO requests to actually
   trickle ICE candidates end-to-end.  Use of SIP INFO happens within
   the context of an Info Package as defined in Section 9.

   The use of INFO requests allows for the Offer/Answer semantics to
   remain exactly the same as already defined in the vanilla ICE
   specification [RFC5245].  From a SIP Offer/Answer perspective, the
   discovery of new candidates through trickling is no different frommpl
   that of peer-reflexive reflexive candidates: it is out of scope.

   In order to be guaranteed delivery to the right endpoint, INFO
   requests transporting additional ICE candidates MUST be sent within
   the SIP dialog established by the Offer and Answer.

   [TODO define an option tag that would allow full trickle]

8.  Encoding and Sending Candidate Information

   Trickled candidates and end-of-candidates indications sent by trickle
   ICE SIP UAs are transported as payload in SIP INFO requests sent
   within the already established dialog.  Such payloads are encoded in
   an SDP format as specified in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice].

   Since neither the "a=candidate" nor the "a=end-of-candidates" lines
   contain information matching them to a stream, this is handled
   through the use of MID [RFC3388] as follows:

9.  Info Package

9.1.  Overall Description

   This specification defines an Info Package meant for use by SIP user
   agents implementing Trickle ICE.  Typically INFO requests would carry
   ICE candidates discovered after the user agent has sent or received a
   trickle-ice offer.

9.2.  Applicability

   The purpose of the ICE protocol is to establish a media path.  The
   candidates that this specification transports in INFO requests are
   part of this establishment.  There is hence no way for them to be
   transported through the not yet existing media path.

   Candidates sent by a trickle ICE agent after the offer, are meant to
   follow the same signalling path and reach the same entity as the
   offer itself.  While it is true that GRUUs can be used to achieve
   this, one of the goals of this specification is to allow operation of
   trickle ICE in as many environments as possible including those with
   no GRUU support.  Using out-of-dialog SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY requests would
   not satisfy this goal.

9.3.  Info Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Info Package as per [RFC6086].  The Info
   Package token name for this package is "trickle-ice"

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP                 June 2014


9.4.  Info Package Parameters

   This document does not define any Info package parameters.

9.5.  SIP Option-Tags

   [RFC6086] allows Info Package specifications to define SIP option-
   tags.  This document therefore stipulates that SIP entities that
   support trickle ICE and this specification MUST place the 'trickle-
   ice' option-tag in a SIP Supported header field.

   When responding to, or generating a SIP OPTIONS request a SIP entity
   MUST also include the 'trickle-ice' option-tag in a SIP Supported
   header field.

9.6.  Info Message Body Parts

   Entities implementing this specification MUST include SDP encoded ICE
   candidates in all SIP INFO requests.  The MIME type for the payload
   MUST be of type 'application/sdp' as defined in Section 8 and
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice].

Appendix A.  Open issues

   At the time of writing of this document the authors have no clear
   view on how and if the following list of issues should be address
   here:

   1.  Should we allow for full trickle if support can be verified
       automatically and confirmed for a gruu with [RFC3840].

   2.  Can we pick between MID and stream indices for stream
       identification.
