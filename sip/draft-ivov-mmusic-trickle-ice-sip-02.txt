       A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) usage for Trickle ICE
                  draft-ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip-02

Abstract

   The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a
   Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal mechanism for UDP-based
   multimedia sessions established with the offer/answer model.  The ICE
   extension for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE)
   defines a mechanism that allows ICE agents to shorten session
   establishment delays by making the candidate gathering and
   connectivity checking phases of ICE non-blocking and by executing
   them in parallel.

   This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

1.  Introduction

   The vanilla specification of the Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (vanilla ICE) protocol [RFC5245] describes a mechanism
   for NAT traversal that consists of three main phases: a phase where
   an agent gathers a set of candidate transport addresses (source IP
   address, port and transport protocol), a second phase where these

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP                 June 2014


   candidates are sent to a remote agent and this gathering procedure is
   repeated and, finally, a third phase where connectivity between all
   candidates in both sets is checked (connectivity checks).  Once these
   phases have been completed, and only then, can both agents begin
   communication.  According to the Vanilla ICE specification the three
   phases above happen consecutively, in a blocking way, which may lead
   to undesirable latency during session establishment.

   The trickle ICE extension defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice]
   defines generic semantics required for these ICE phases to happen
   simultaneously, in a non-blocking way and hence speed up session
   establishment.

   The present specification defines a usage of trickle ICE with the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  It describes how ICE candidates
   are to be incrementally exchanged with SIP INFO requests and how the
   half and full-trickle modes defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice]
   are to be used by SIP User Agents (UAs) depending on their
   expectations for support of trickle ICE by a remote agent.

   This document defines a new Info Package [RFC6086] for use with
   Trickle ICE.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification makes use of all terminology defined by the
   protocol for Interactive Connectivity Establishment in [RFC5245] and
   its Trickle ICE extension [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice].  It is
   assumed that the reader will be familiar with the terminology from
   both of them.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The semantics that vanilla ICE [RFC5245] defines for exchanging ICE
   candidates are exclusively based on use of Offers and Answers as per
   [RFC3264] over the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].
   This specification extends these mechanism by allowing ICE candidates
   to also be sent after the completion of Offer/Answer negotiation,
   through the use of SIP INFO messages and a newly defined Info Package
   [RFC6086].

   Specifically, in cases where trickle ICE is fully supported A typical
   exchange would happen along the following lines: The offerer would
   send an INVITE containing a subset of candidates and then wait for an

   early dialog to be established.  Once that happens, it will be able
   to continue sending candidates through in INFO requests and within
   the same dialog.

   Similarly, once it has sent an answer (though not earlier) an
   answerer can continue "trickling" ICE candidates using INFO messages
   within the dialog established by its 183 Session Progress response.
   Figure 1 shows such a sample exchange:

3.1.  Rationale.  Why INFO

   The decision to use SIP INFO requests as a candidate transport method
   is based primarily on their lightweight nature.  Once a dialog has
   been established, INFO messages can be exchanged both ways with no
   restrictions on timing and frequency and no risk of collision.




Ivov, et al.            Expires December 17, 2014               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP                 June 2014


   On the other hand, using offer/answer and UPDATE requests, which from
   an [RFC5245] perspective is the traditional way of transporting ICE
   candidates, introduces the following complications:

   Need for a turn-based mechanism:   [RFC3264] defines Offer/Answer as
      a strictly sequential mechanism.  There can only be a maximum of
      one exchange at any point of time.  Both sides cannot
      simultaneously send offers nor can they generate multiple offers
      prior to receiving an answer.  Using UPDATEs for candidate
      transport would therefore imply the implementation of a candidate
      pool at every agent where candidates can be stored until it is
      once again that agent's "turn" to emit an answer or a new offer.
      Such an approach would introduce non-negligible complexity for no
      additional value.

   Elevated risk of glare:   The sequential nature of Offer/Answer also
      makes it impossible for both sides to send offers simultaneously.
      What's worse is that there are no mechanisms in SIP to actually
      prevent that.  [RFC3261], where the situation of offers crossing
      on the wire is described as "glare", only defines a procedure for
      addressing the issue after it has occurred.  According to that
      procedure both offers are invalidated and both sides need to retry
      the negotiation after a period between 0 and 4 seconds.  The high
      likelihood for glare to occur and the average two second backoff
      intervals would imply trickle ICE processing duration would not
      only fail to improve but actually exceed those of vanilla ICE.

   INFO messages have no impact on the Offer/Answer negotiation and are
   subject to none of the glare issues described above, which makes them
   a very convenient and lightweight mechanism for asynchronous delivery
   of candidates.

   Using in-dialog INFO messages also provides a way of guaranteeing
   that candidates are delivered end-to-end, between the same entities
   that are actually in the process of initiating a session.  The
   alternative would have implied requiring support for Globally
   Routable UA URI (GRUU) [RFC5627] which, given GRUUs relatively low
   adoption levels, would have constituted too strong of constraint to
   the adoption of trickle ICE.

3.2.  Discovery issues

   In order for to benefit from trickle ICE's full potential and reduce
   session establishment latency to a minimum, trickle ICE agents need
   to generate SDP offers and answers that contain incomplete,
   potentially empty sets of candidates.  Such offers and answers can
   only be handled meaningfully by agents that actually support

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP                 June 2014


   incremental candidate provisioning, which implies the need to confirm
   such support before actually using it.

   Contrary to other protocols, like XMPP [RFC6120], where "in advance"
   capability discovery is widely implemented, the mechanisms that allow
   this for sip (i.e., a combination of UA Capabilities [RFC3840] and
   GRUU [RFC5627]) have only seen low levels of adoption.  This presents
   an issue for trickle ICE implementations as SIP UAs do not have an
   obvious means of verifying that their peer will support incremental
   candidate provisioning.

   The "half trickle" mode of operation defined in the trickle ICE
   specification [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice] provides one way around
   this, by requiring first offers to contain a complete set of ICE
   candidates and only using incremental provisioning for the rest of
   the sessions.

   While using "half trickle" does provide a working solution it also
   comes at the price of increased latency.  Section 5 therefore makes
   several alternative suggestions that enable SIP UAs to engage in full
   trickle right from their first offer: Section 5.1 discusses the use
   of on-line provisioning as a means of allowing use of trickle ICE for
   all endpoints in controlled environments.  Section 5.2 describes the
   possibility to simply assume support of trickle ICE in a "leap of
   faith" way by then falling back to regular Offer/Answer semantics.
   Section 5.3 describes anticipatory discovery for implementations that
   actually do support GRUU and UA Capabilities and Section 5.5
   discusses the implementation and use of "half trickle" by SIP UAs
   where none of the above are an option.

3.3.  Relationship with the Offer/Answer Model

   It is important to note that this specification does not require,
   define, or even assume any mechanisms that would have an impact on
   the Offer/Answer model beyond the way it is already used by vanilla
   ICE [RFC5245].  From the perspective of all SIP middle boxes and
   proxies, and with the exception of the actual INFO messages,
   signalling in general and Offer/Answer exchanges in particular would
   look the same way for trickle as they would for vanilla ICE.

       Figure 2: Distinguishing between trickle ICE and traditional
                                signalling.

   It is important to note that, as displayed on Figure 2, exchanging
   candidates through SIP INFO messages are best represented as
   signalling between ICE agents and not between the traditional SIP and
   Offer/Answer modules of SIP User Agents.  Such INFO requests do not
   impact the state of Offer/Answer, nor do they have an impact on the
   version number in the "o=" line.  In that regard they are actually
   comparable to Peer Reflexive candidates that ICE agents can discover
   during ICE processing.

4.  Incremental signalling of ICE candidates

   Trickle ICE agents will construct offers and answers the same way a
   [RFC5245] compatible agent would, with the following two main
   differences:

   First, all offers and answers sent by the trickle ICE capable agents
   MUST indicate support for trickle ICE through the "trickle" ice-
   options tag defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice].

   Second, with the possible exception of the first offer sent during
   half trickle negotiations, all offers and answers may contain all,
   some, or no ICE candidates at all.

   Once an agent has sent an offer or an answer indicating support for
   trickle ICE, it MUST be prepared to receive SIP INFO requests within
   that same dialog, containing additional candidates or an indication
   for the end of such candidates.

   Similarly, as soon as a SIP UA has established a dialog (including an
   early state one) it MAY begin sending INFO requests containing such
   additional candidates or end-of-candidates indications.  Such INFO
   request MUST be sent within the dialog established by the SIP
   messages, which delivered the corresponding Offer and Answer.  This
   is necessary so that the candidates from these INFO messages could be
   delivered to the same entities that initiated the session.

4.1.  Encoding and Sending Candidate Information

   The use of SIP INFO requests happens within the context of an Info
   Package specifically defined for the purpose (Section 6).

   Such INFO requests are sent within an existing dialog.  The MIME type
   for their payload MUST be set to 'application/sdp'.

   Since neither the "a=candidate" nor the "a=end-of-candidates" lines
   contain information matching them to a stream, this is handled
   through the use of MID [RFC3388]: all lines following an "a=mid"
   line, up until (and excluding) the next occurrence of an "a=mid"
   line, pertain the the "m=" line that the MID is referring to.

   All INFO requests MUST carry the ice-pwd and ice-ufrag attributes
   that would allow mapping them to a specific ICE generation.  This
   would allow agents to disregard out of order requests that have, for
   example, arrived after an ICE restart and are no longer valid.

   Every INFO request MUST carry all candidates that the agent has
   previously sent within a dialog, in order to more easily avoid
   problems that would arise from misordering and unreliability.

   The following is an eample


         INFO sip:alice@example.com SIP/2.0
         ...
         Info-Package: trickle-ice
         Content-type: application/sdp
         Content-Disposition: Info-Package
         Content-length: ...

         a=ice-pwd:asd88fgpdd777uzjYhagZg
         a=ice-ufrag:8hhY
         a=mid:1
         a=candidate:1 1 UDP 1658497328 192.168.100.33 5000 typ host
         a=candidate:2 1 UDP 1658497328 96.1.2.3 5000 typ srflx
         a=mid:2
         a=candidate:2 1 UDP 1658497328 96.1.2.3 5002 typ srflx
         a=end-of-candidates


5.  Initial discovery of trickle ICE support

   SIP User Agents (UAs) that support and intend to use trickle ICE are
   REQUIRED by [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice] to indicate that in their
   offers and answers using the following attribute: "a=ice-
   options:trickle".  This makes discovery fairly straightforward for
   answerers or for cases where offers need to be generated within
   existing dialogs (i.e., when sending re-INVITE requests).  In both
   scenarios prior SDP would have provided the necessary information.

   Obviously, prior SDP is not available at the time a first offer is
   being constructed and it is therefore impossible for ICE agents to
   determine support for incremental provisioning that way.  The
   following options are suggested as ways of addressing this issue.

5.1.  Provisioning support for trickle ICE

5.2.  Leap of faith.  Assuming support for trickle ICE

5.3.  Trickle ICE discovery with GRUU and UA Capabilities

   [TODO define an option tag that would allow full trickle to be
   discovered and describe how it could be used with OPTIONS]

5.4.  Trickle ICE discovery through other protocols

5.5.  Fallback to half trickle

   The "half trickle" mode defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice]
   allows an agent to initiate session negotiation and ICE processing as
   a ICE defines a mode of operation called "half trickle".  With half
   trickle, agents initiate sessions the same way they would when using
   vanilla ICE [RFC5245].  This means that, prior to actually sending an
   offer, agents would first gather ICE candidates in a blocking way and
   then send them all in that offer.  The blocking nature of the process
   would likely imply that some amount of latency will be accumulated
   and it is advised that agents try to anticipate it where possible.
   The upside is that the resulting offer would be compatible with
   vanilla ICE and legacy [RFC3264] endpoints both.

   A typical successful (half) trickle ICE exchange with SIP would look
   this way:

                             Figure 3: Example

   Trickle ICE agents SHOULD therefore perform half trickle unless
   support for trickle has been confirmed for a specific answerer.  This
   could either happen through the use of [RFC3840] in an endpoint
   specific way (e.g. with GRUU) or because it has been confirmed with
   an earlier Offer/Answer exchange within the same session.

   Assuming support for trickle MAY also be forced through
   configuration.  This could, for example, be the case in controlled
   environments where every agent is known to support trickle ICE.

   After receiving a half trickle offer (which is virtually equivalent
   to a vanilla ICE offer but with an extra indication for trickle ICE
   support), answerers can continue negotiation fully using trickle ICE
   semantics.

6.  Info Package

6.1.  Overall Description

   This specification defines an Info Package meant for use by SIP user
   agents implementing Trickle ICE.  Typically INFO requests would carry
   ICE candidates discovered after the user agent has sent or received a
   trickle-ice offer.

6.2.  Applicability

   The purpose of the ICE protocol is to establish a media path.  The
   candidates that this specification transports in INFO requests are
   part of this establishment.  There is hence no way for them to be
   transported through the not yet existing media path.

   Candidates sent by a trickle ICE agent after the offer, are meant to
   follow the same signalling path and reach the same entity as the
   offer itself.  While it is true that GRUUs can be used to achieve
   this, one of the goals of this specification is to allow operation of
   trickle ICE in as many environments as possible including those with
   no GRUU support.  Using out-of-dialog SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY requests would
   not satisfy this goal.

6.3.  Info Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Info Package as per [RFC6086].  The Info
   Package token name for this package is "trickle-ice"

6.4.  Info Package Parameters

   This document does not define any Info package parameters.

6.5.  SIP Option-Tags

   [RFC6086] allows Info Package specifications to define SIP option-
   tags.  This document therefore stipulates that SIP entities that
   support trickle ICE and this specification MUST place the 'trickle-
   ice' option-tag in a SIP Supported header field.

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP                 June 2014


   When responding to, or generating a SIP OPTIONS request a SIP entity
   MUST also include the 'trickle-ice' option-tag in a SIP Supported
   header field.

6.6.  Info Message Body Parts

   Entities implementing this specification MUST include SDP encoded ICE
   candidates in all SIP INFO requests.  The MIME type for the payload
   MUST be of type 'application/sdp' as defined in Section 4.1 and
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice].

Appendix A.  Open issues

   At the time of writing of this document the authors have no clear
   view on how and if the following list of issues should be address
   here:

   1.  Should we allow for full trickle if support can be verified
       automatically and confirmed for a gruu with [RFC3840].

   2.  Can we pick between MID and stream indices for stream
       identification.
