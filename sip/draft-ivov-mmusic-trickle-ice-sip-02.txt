       A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) usage for Trickle ICE
                  draft-ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip-02

Abstract

   The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a
   Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia
   sessions established with the offer/answer model.  The ICE extension
   for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a
   mechanism that allows ICE agents to shorten session establishment
   delays by making the candidate gathering and connectivity checking
   phases of ICE non-blocking.

   This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with SIP.

1.  Introduction

   The vanilla specification of the Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (vanilla ICE) protocol [RFC5245] describes a mechanism
   for NAT traversal that consists of three main phases: a phase where
   an agent gathers a set of candidate 5-tuples (source IP address and
   port, destination IP address and port and a transport protocol), a
   second phase where these candidates are sent to a remote agent and
   this gathering is repeated and then a third phase where connectivity
   between all candidates in both sets is checked (connectivity checks).
   Only then can both agents begin communication, provided of course
   that ICE processing has successfully completed.  According to that
   specification the three phases above happen consecutively, in a
   blocking way, which may lead to undesirable latency during session
   establishment.

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP                 June 2014


   The trickle ICE extension defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice]
   defines generic semantics required for these ICE phases to happen
   simultaneously, in a non-blocking way and hence speed up session
   establishment.

   This specification defines a usage of trickle ICE with the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP).  It also describes how and when SIP agents
   use the full and half trickle modes of operation, how they encode
   additional candidates and how they exchange them through use of SIP
   INFO requests.

   This document also defines a new Info Package for use with Trickle
   ICE.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification makes use of all terminology defined by the
   protocol for Interactive Connectivity Establishment in [RFC5245] and
   its Trickle ICE extension [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice].  It is
   assumed that the reader will be familiar with the terminology from
   both of them.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The semantics that vanilla ICE [RFC5245] defines for exchanging ICE
   candidates are exclusively based on use of Offers and Answers as per
   [RFC3264] over the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC3264].
   This specification extends these mechanism by allowing ICE candidates
   to also be sent after the completion of Offer/Answer negotiation,
   through the use of SIP INFO messages [RFC6086].

   In other words, in cases where trickle ICE is fully supported, once
   an INVITE has been sent with an offer and a (n early) dialog has been
   established, the offerer can continue sending additional candidates
   through the use of in-dialog INFO requests.

   Similarly, as soon as it has sent an answer (though not earlier) an
   answerer can continue "trickling" ICE candidates using INFO messages.

                             Figure 1: Example

   In order to guarantee the end-to-end delivery of ICE candidates
   without requiring support for Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU)
   [RFC5627], trickle ICE relies on using in-dialog INFO requests.

   Also, in addition to avoid backward compatibility issues, this
   specifications mandates that, prior to initiating trickle ICE
   semantics, an agent confirms support of trickle ICE by their peer.
   This is either achieved through confirming user agent capabilities
   (which potentially requires support for GRUU) or through the half
   trickle mode defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice].

   Use of half trickle is particularly convenient for SIP as it provides
   a workaround for SIP's lack of reliable and widely deployed end-to-
   end capability discovery.  While [RFC3840] does define a way for SIP
   User Agents (UAs) to query their peers for capabilities, directing
   such queries to specific endpoints also requires support for GRUU.

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP                 June 2014


   Without GRUU, there would be no guarantee that the endpoint that
   receives and handles an OPTIONS request carrying a capability query,
   is the same as the endpoint that will then receive and handle the
   following INVITE.

   Use of GRUU is one solution to this problem, and this specification
   allows that when available.  Making use of trickle ICE in more
   conventional SIP deployments, however, would only be possible through
   the half trickle semantics defined in Section 4.

4.  Half vs Full Trickle

   Trickle ICE defines a mode of operation called "half trickle".  With
   half trickle, agents initiate sessions the same way they would when
   using vanilla ICE [RFC5245].  This means that, prior to actually
   sending an offer, agents would first gather ICE candidates in a
   blocking way and then send them all in that offer.  The blocking
   nature of the process would likely imply that some amount of latency
   will be accumulated and it is advised that agents try to anticipate
   it where possible.  The upside is that the resulting offer would be
   compatible with vanilla ICE and legacy [RFC3264] endpoints both.

   A typical successful (half) trickle ICE exchange with SIP would look
   this way:

   Trickle ICE agents SHOULD therefore perform half trickle unless
   support for trickle has been confirmed for a specific answerer.  This
   could either happen through the use of [RFC3840] in an endpoint
   specific way (e.g. with GRUU) or because it has been confirmed with
   an earlier Offer/Answer exchange within the same session.

   Assuming support for trickle MAY also be forced through
   configuration.  This could, for example, be the case in controlled
   environments where every agent is known to support trickle ICE.

   After receiving a half trickle offer (which is virtually equivalent
   to a vanilla ICE offer but with an extra indication for trickle ICE
   support), answerers can continue negotiation fully using trickle ICE
   semantics.

5.  Performing trickle ICE with SIP

   This specification relies on in-dialog SIP INFO requests to actually
   trickle ICE candidates end-to-end.  Use of SIP INFO happens within
   the context of an INFO package as defined in Section 8.

   The use of INFO requests allows for the Offer/Answer semantics to
   remain exactly the same as already defined in the vanilla ICE
   specification [RFC5245].  From a SIP Offer/Answer perspective, the
   discovery of new candidates through trickling is no different frommpl
   that of peer-reflexive reflexive candidates: it is out of scope.

   In order to be guaranteed delivery to the right endpoint, INFO
   requests transporting additional ICE candidates MUST be sent within
   the SIP dialog established by the Offer and Answer.

   [TODO define an option tag that would allow full trickle]

7.  Encoding and Sending Candidate Information

   Trickled candidates and end-of-candidates indications sent by trickle
   ICE SIP UAs are transported as payload in SIP INFO requests sent
   within the already established dialog.  Such payloads are encoded in
   an SDP format as specified in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice].

   Since neither the "a=candidate" nor the "a=end-of-candidates" lines
   contain information matching them to a stream, this is handled
   through the use of MID [RFC3388] as follows:

8.  Info Package

8.1.  Overall Description

   This specification defines an INFO package meant for use by SIP user
   agents implementing Trickle ICE.  Typically INFO requests would carry
   ICE candidates discovered after the user agent has sent or received a
   trickle-ice offer.

8.2.  Applicability

   The purpose of the ICE protocol is to establish a media path.  The
   candidates that this specification transports in INFO requests are
   part of this establishment.  There is hence no way for them to be
   transported through the not yet existing media path.

   Candidates sent by a trickle ICE agent after the offer, are meant to
   follow the same signalling path and reach the same entity as the
   offer itself.  While it is true that GRUUs can be used to achieve
   this, one of the goals of this specification is to allow operation of
   trickle ICE in as many environments as possible including those with
   no GRUU support.  Using out-of-dialog SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY requests would
   not satisfy this goal.

8.3.  INFO Package Name

   This document defines a SIP INFO Package as per [RFC6086].  The INFO
   Package token name for this package is "trickle-ice"

8.4.  INFO Package Parameters

   This document does not define any INFO package parameters.

8.5.  SIP Option-Tags

   [RFC6086] allows Info Package specifications to define SIP option-
   tags.  This document therefore stipulates that SIP entities that
   support trickle ICE and this specification MUST place the 'trickle-
   ice' option-tag in a SIP Supported header field.

   When responding to, or generating a SIP OPTIONS request a SIP entity
   MUST also include the 'trickle-ice' option-tag in a SIP Supported
   header field.

8.6.  INFO Message Body Parts

   Entities implementing this specification MUST include SDP encoded ICE
   candidates in all SIP INFO requests.  The MIME type for the payload
   MUST be of type 'application/sdp' as defined in Section 7 and
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice].

Appendix A.  Open issues

   At the time of writing of this document the authors have no clear
   view on how and if the following list of issues should be address
   here:

   1.  Should we allow for full trickle if support can be verified
       automatically and confirmed for a gruu with [RFC3840].

   2.  Can we pick between MID and stream indices for stream
       identification.
