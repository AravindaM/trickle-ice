V  1.  Introduction

V  3.  Protocol Overview 
      3.1 rationale
X       . why trikcle ice (copy from trickle ice draft)
V       . why INFO
V     3.2 Discovery of trickle ICE support (Half vs. Full Trickle) (you already have this)
V       . intro to the discovery problem
V       . options for discovery: 
V         ..GRUUs with OPTIONS, presence, 
V         .. (CUSAX?)
V         ..configuration, 
V         .. falling back to half trickle
V         .. leap of faith and fall back to 3264.
V     3.3.  Offer answer relationship
V         ..offer answer does not depend on trickle ice. it is the same as 5245.8     
V         ..peer-reflexive example      
   

   4. Incremental Signaling of Discovered Candidates
V	4.1 The 'trikle-ice' INFO package
V		. it carries sdpfrag
V		. it is incremental (we should say how to identify candidates, full vs partial comparisons)
V		. matching INFO requests to ICE generations
V		. example of an INFO req
	4.2 Satisfying the SIP dialog states
		. make clear that unrealiable transport == ALWAYS
		. prack
		. acknowledging receipt
X	4.3 Trickle-ice option tag
V	4.4. Trickle-ice support discovery
V		. option tag in in-dialog messages
V		. does not solve the problem of getting rid of half-trickle -> not enough to do full trickle
V		. OPTIONS with GRUU
V		. Presence (I would just put a placeholder here, with an open Q for the WG)
V	4.5. Half Trickle

Open issues:
	why not send info requests before the confirmation
	send info and consider the dialog ok
		when you get an info (end of candidates)
		when you get a successful final response to an INFO from the answerer

what happens if you get a 183 with no ICE info?
	wrong?
	3264?
