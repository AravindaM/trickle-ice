V  2.  Terminology
	reuse
V  3.  Protocol Overview 
      3.1 rationale
X       . why trikcle ice (copy from trickle ice draft)
V       . why INFO
      3.2 Discovery of trickle ICE support (Half vs. Full Trickle) (you already have this)
        . intro to the discovery problem
        . options for discovery: 
          ..GRUUs with OPTIONS, presence, 
          .. (CUSAX?)
	  ..configuration, 
	  .. falling back to half trickle
	  .. leap of faith and fall back to 3264.
      3.3.  Offer answer relationship
            offer answer does not depend on trickle ice. it is the same as 5245.8     
            peer-reflexive example      
   

   4. Incremental Signaling of Discovered Candidates
	4.1 The 'trikle-ice' INFO package
		. it carries sdpfrag
		. it is incremental (we should say how to identify candidates, full vs partial comparisons)
		. matching INFO requests to ICE generations
		. example of an INFO req
	4.2 Satisfying the SIP dialog states
		. make clear that unrealiable transport == ALWAYS
		. prack
		. acknowledging receipt
	4.3 Trickle-ice option tag
	4.4. Trickle-ice support discovery
		. option tag in in-dialog messages
		. does not solve the problem of getting rid of half-trickle -> not enough to do full trickle
		. OPTIONS with GRUU
		. Presence (I would just put a placeholder here, with an open Q for the WG)
	4.5. Half Trickle

Open issues:
	why not send info requests before the confirmation
	send info and consider the dialog ok
		when you get an info (end of candidates)
		when you get a successful final response to an INFO from the answerer

what happens if you get a 183 with no ICE info?
	wrong?
	3264?
